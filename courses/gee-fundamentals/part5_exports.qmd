## Introduction

After you've analyzed your satellite imagery, calculated indices, or summarized statistics, you typically want to get the data *out* of Google Earth Engine. You might want a GeoTIFF to use in QGIS/ArcGIS, a CSV file of your statistics to analyze in Excel or R, or a video for a presentation.

In GEE, this process is called **Exporting**, and it is handled by the `Export` module.

## The Tasks Tab

When you run an export command, nothing downloads immediately. Instead, a **Task** is created in the **Tasks** tab (right-hand panel of the Code Editor). You must go to that tab and click "Run" to actually start the export.

## 1. Exporting Images (`Export.image`)

To save a raster (like a satellite image or a map of NDVI) to your Google Drive.

```javascript
// Load an image (e.g., SRTM elevation)
var image = ee.Image("USGS/SRTMGL1_003");
var region = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([-122.5, 37.0, -122.0, 37.5]);

// Export a GeoTIFF to Google Drive
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: image,
  description: 'SRTM_Elevation_Export',
  folder: 'GEE_Exports', // Folder in your Google Drive using exact name
  region: region,     // Area to export
  scale: 30,          // Resolution in meters
  crs: 'EPSG:4326',   // Coordinate system (optional, defaults to image's native or WGS84)
  maxPixels: 1e9      // Increase if your area is large
});
```

### Important Tips:
*   **region**: Always filter the export to your area of interest. Exporting the whole world at 30m resolution isn't possible!
*   **scale**: Define the resolution.
*   **folder**: GEE will create this folder in your Drive if it doesn't exist.

## 2. Exporting Tables (`Export.table`)

To save vector data (Features) or statistics (Dictionaries turned into Features) as CSV, SHP, or GeoJSON.

```javascript
// Assume we have a FeatureCollection called 'countyStats' from the previous lesson
Export.table.toDrive({
  collection: countyStats,
  description: 'County_Stats_Export',
  folder: 'GEE_Features',
  fileFormat: 'CSV' // Options: 'CSV', 'GeoJSON', 'KML', 'SHP' (as Shapefile)
});
```

## 3. Exporting to Assets

If you want to use your processed image or vector in *another* GEE script without recalculating it every time, export it to your **Assets**.

```javascript
Export.image.toAsset({
  image: image,
  description: 'SRTM_Asset_Export',
  assetId: 'users/yourusername/srtm_clip',
  region: region,
  scale: 30
});
```

## Summary
1.  Use `Export.image.toDrive()` for rasters (GeoTIFFs).
2.  Use `Export.table.toDrive()` for vectors and statistics (CSV, Shapefile).
3.  Remember to click **Run** in the Tasks tab.
4.  Always specify `region` and `scale`.

Congratulations! You've completed the Fundamentals of Google Earth Engine. You can now search for data, filter it, analyze it, and export the results.
