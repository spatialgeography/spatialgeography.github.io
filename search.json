The climate change mitigation potential of different on-farm practices depends on many site-specific factors such as geography, climate, soil type, and management history.\nTo maximize the climate change mitigation potential of the SFF program, and to optimize the use of every dollar, a decision support tool is required. This presentation demonstrates how two existing spatial datasets (NRCS’ COMET-Planner and WSDA’s Agricultural Land Use) can be integrated into a decision support tool using ArcGIS Dashboards and Experience Builder. This tool, called the Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE), allows users to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across different counties in Washington.\nBy utilizing the intuitive user interface of ArcGIS Dashboards, WaCSE enables swift, science-based estimates of climate benefits, while remaining accessible for audiences of varied technical backgrounds.\nSee the old app built with ArcGIS.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

In the last decade, more tools and models have been developed to consider the interactive effects of chemicals within a mixture when conducting risk assessments. Therefore, this study uses actual environmental concentrations measured in 2018 and 2019 from the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Surface Water Monitoring Program. Aquatic risk from exposure was assessed from chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion (as individual chemicals and as binary and ternary mixtures) using the concentration addition model. These pesticides were selected because they have a common mechanism of toxicity, are frequently detected in surface waters in Washington, and were recently evaluated in a biological opinion by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nAll detected concentrations of chlorpyrifos and malathion, assessed as individual chemicals, exceeded the predicted no effect concentration, indicating potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. Further, risk quotients for all binary and ternary mixtures were greater than one, also indicative of potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. In all samples containing a mixture, the maximum cumulative ratio suggested that a single insecticide contributed &gt;50% of the overall toxicity of each mixture. Based on the individual and mixture risk quotients, chlorpyrifos and malathion were the primary drivers of the toxicity of each mixture.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

    "text": "Celebrating our collective survival\n Getting up and surviving each of the last 365 days is an accomplishment in itself. We’re all still adjusting from the COVID-19 pandemic phase to the endemic phase; dealing with changes from remote to hybrid or in-person work; and coping with the current state of politics, economics, climate disasters, and war. As we reflect on our year, I hope we can honor the lives lost, lessons learned, and feel proud that, despite all that’s wrong in the world, we managed to keep our heads above water.\nFor the last week, I’ve been thinking about my experience through 2023 and been considering writing the cliche end of year review post. It’s 9:09 PM on 123123 and I’ve decided I do want to jot down my reflections – raw and unedited. Typos, rambling, incoherence, and disorganization guaranteed 😉.\n\n\nFrom 2022 to 2023\nThe year started off pretty rough for me. This was my second year in this data scientist role where everything (soil science, data management, programming) was new to me. I was disappointed in myself because I only accomplished about half of my 2022 goals and worried that I was also disappointing my supervisor and colleagues. I was wondering if I made a mistake in this career transition from a field-based environmental scientist to a data scientist. On a daily basis, I really struggled with imposter syndrome and worried that I was holding back these important statewide programs and initiatives because I was slow and needed to learn so much on the job.\n\n\nFirst rejection\nI submitted a talk proposal to present {WaCSE}, my first Shiny app used for a statewide agricultural grant program, at Appsilon’s Shiny Conf. I submitted the abstract at the end of 2022 and got the rejection notice at the end of January 2023. This was my third conference proposal I’ve ever submitted in the four years of my professional career and my first rejection. My learned lesson here was to put more thought into which category I submit to (20-min talk versus showcase section) and make the idea more unique. The feedback from the review committee was that my talk fell under the category “tools to facilitate data access” and there were quite a few of those. This rejection certainly added to my feelings of being an imposter and not deserving my job.\nThough with the support and encouragement of my supervisor, I kept trying and also submitted talk proposals for 2023 Cascadia R Conf and posit::conf(2023).\n\n\nOne project/talk, many firsts\nIn March, things started to look more hopeful as I got my first invitation to speak at an R-Ladies Seattle lightning talk event: R in the Outdoors. This one invitation led to so many of my firsts including my:\n\nfirst invitation to speak\nfirst web scraping project\nfirst R package\nfirst in-person talk\nfirst R-Ladies Seattle event\nfirst Seattle useR group event\n\nWhile these all are huge accomplishments to me, I also realize that it’s totally natural because I am so new to the R and coding space. Nevertheless, April 20, 2023 was a huge day for me as this was the first moment since RStudio::con(2022) that I really felt a sense of belonging in the R community.\n This was also my first in-person talk of my professional career! I used this as an opportunity to learn new skills through a personal project. I’ve always had an affinity for the Southern Resident Killer Whales in the Salish Sea. The Center for Whale Research does a lot of really fascinating and important work monitoring their population. They post their survey data on their website; each encounter with the orcas is a separate webpage. I’d been curious and intimidated by web scraping so I decided this would make a great case study and personal project.\nWith the encouragement from new friends I met at the R-Ladies event, we ended up also going to the Seattle useR Group lightning talks meetup afterwards. I spontaneously gave the same presentation there!\nCheck out the {orcas} package repo and talk materials.\n\n\nFirst WADE (attendance & talk)\n Outside of the R community and moreso in my capacity as the data scientist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture, I was invited to present at the Washington Association of District Employees (WADE). I presented on the Washington Soil Health Initiative and {WaCSE}.\nSee the talk materials.\n\n\nFirst Master of Science degree\nIn August, I graduated from Montana State University’s online Land Resources and Environmental Sciences program with a Master of Science. It took me about three years of part-time school with full-time work to complete this degree. I really enjoyed the online aspect of the program as it allowed me to really focus on what was applicable to my job, rather than rote memorization of lots of content I didn’t really need for my day-to-day work. I am a big proponent of learning how to learn in primary and secondary education [thanks dad for teaching me this mentality ☺️], and then using those learning skills to dive deeper into a domain you want to pursue for postsecondary education.\nFor my professional project (aka the cheaper version of a thesis), I got to learn some JavaScript and Google Earth Engine to model wind-driven soil erosion in Washington State’s Columbia Plateau.\nSee the repo and my presentation recording.\n\n\nFirst Cascadia Conf (attendance & talk)\n Given my rejection for Shiny Conf, I definitely didn’t expect to be accepted for Cascadia R Conf or Posit. I used the lessons from my first proposal and made this proposal more unique by focusing less on the Shiny app as a data access tool, and more on the development process and lessons learned from creating our first Shiny app.\nSee the talk materials.\nThis was my first time attending Cascadia Conf and I’ve got to say that it is an endearing and enlightening experience. It’s more local and tight-knit than RStudio/Posit conf. I appreciated the smaller size, venue, and one track style of conference. I really enjoyed meeting people I’ve known online in person and making entirely new friends and connections. I loved the experience so much that I volunteered to be on the planning committee for 2024 conf! I’ll be working on the hex logo, paper materials, the witty committee to come up with quirky, fun activities, and helping to update the website.\n\n\nFirst Posit Conf talk\n Since I already revised the {WaCSE} Shiny talk from the Appsilon Shiny Conf proposal for Cascadia R Conf, I wanted to submit a different topic just in case. So I decided to try a talk about the parameterized soil health Quarto reports. Getting my talk proposal accepted for posit::conf was probably the most shocking news I had for 2023. The call for proposals required an abstract and a 1-minute video pitching the idea for the talk and what I hope the audience will walk away with. I was incredibly intimidated but the amazing Rachael Dempsey wrote a very encouraging and helpful LinkedIn post for those nervous about the video.\n\n\nRead Rachael’s post\n\n\n\n\nI strongly encourage anyone to submit a talk for next year’s conference in Seattle! You never know if you don’t at least try. Posit provides speaker coaching through Articulation, which is so incredibly helpful for learning how to weave a story into your presentation, even with code-based content.\nSee the talk materials.\n\n\nGeneral thoughts from my four talks this year\nI’ve always been extremely nervous about public speaking. So much anxiety, shaking, sweating, red face, voice cracking, and lightheadedness that I would take propranolol to help. This year I didn’t need it though. I definitely felt nervous and shaky. But not to the same extent. Once I got started presenting, I (for the most part) felt nervous-excited to share whatever I was talking about.\nReflecting on how I felt each talk, I’ve realized that I’m naturally more confident talking about things that I really care about and am professionally and personally invested in. Instead of presenting random research for school projects in my high school and undergraduate classes, I’m presenting projects that I’ve invested dozens of hours in learning, crafting, and perfecting.\n\n\nFirst invitation for a workshop\n After my posit::conf talk, Arati Krishnamoorthy came up to me to congratulate me on my presentation and ask if I was interested in leading a workshop as a longer version of my talk on parameterized Quarto reports. Of course I said yes, even though I’ve never led a workshop before. It’ll be my first first [workshop] of 2024 on January 18th!\nRegister for the R-Ladies Washington D.C. Meetup.\nSo far, I’ve really enjoyed these R focused presentations and teaching. Depending on how the workshop goes, I’m considering applying for The Carpentries Trainer Training Program to better learn how to teach. After all, my husband is an instructional coach (with 5 years of elementary teaching under his belt).\n\n\nFirst personal website and blog\nMillie Symnns wrote a blog post and gave an excellent posit::conf(2023) talk about the side effects of blogging that inspired me to create my own website and blog. Since RStudio::Conf(2022), I’ve been obsessed with Quarto so the technology behind a website and blog obviously had to be Quarto. It was a blast coming back from Posit Conf and immediately applying what I learned to build my own personal portfolio and website.\n\n\nFirst small business - Etsy shop\nAt Cascadia Conf and Posit Conf, I used my Cricut and heat transfer vinyl to create my own cat and code themed shirts to wear as conversation starters. At both conferences, I made new friends because I was approachable and immediately had two common interests to talk about (R and cats 😻). People asked where I got my shirts and encouraged me to make them available. So to spread the joy and allow others to proudly share/wear their interests, I set up a sole proprietorship, started a small business called The Coding Cats, and launched an Etsy shop found at thecodingcats.etsy.com/!\nIn 2024, I hope to move from Etsy to a Shopify store that lives on the The Coding Cats tab of my website to avoid the excessive Etsy fees.\n\n\nFirst freelance job\nLastly, my first freelance job sort of fell into my lap when a friend referred me to one of their colleagues who was looking for someone to convert their RMarkdown website to Quarto. I picked the brain of my friend to learn about freelancing, listened to some episodes of The Business of Authority podcast, decided on project-based billing rather than hourly billing, consulted with the client, wrote up a proposal, and then began the work.\nI actually just finished the next stage of the project earlier today 😀.\nWhile I’m not actively looking for freelance work, I’m happy to entertain the idea and set up a short call to see if I would be a good fit for your project if it involves pretty much anything Quarto.\n\n\nLast thoughts\nI appreciate you sticking through my ramblings (including my future self)!\nThe year started out with imposter syndrome, so much self-doubt, and one rejection. But with the support from my community, I kept on keeping on. My general theme for the year was perseverance through failures and insecurities to finally get to the realization that I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. I’m learning as I go, and that’s perfectly okay! My learning directly feeds into my sense of belonging within the R community. This community is so amazing at lifting each other up as we all learn together and support each other. We’re all collectively trying to use the latest technologies and best practices to gain insights from our data and make the world a better place.\nHere’s to 2024 being another year of learning, being vulnerable, and lifting each other up!\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ryan2023,\n  author = {Ryan, Jadey},\n  title = {2023: A Year of Firsts},\n  date = {2023-12-31},\n  url = {https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-12-31_year-of-firsts/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRyan, Jadey. 2023. “2023: A Year of Firsts.” December 31,\n2023. https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-12-31_year-of-firsts/."

    "text": "First off, I want to say that I’m strongly resisting my perfectionism and time-blocked this blog post to about one hour! This is a very vulnerable and unpolished post, so please be gentle. 😌\nA couple days ago, three ✨expert✨ R package developers and reviewers looked at my package:\nThe idea to livestream a R package review came from Nick Tierney. Others favorited, boosted, and commented on the Mastodon post, including myself. I’ve been working on this {soils} R package and am in the review/revise period of package development. Before I could get second thoughts, I volunteered this package for review. I was quite nervous about putting my work out there for critique, but I’m so happy that I did. And so grateful that Nick, Miles, and Adam all shared their brilliance! 🧠😇\nI’ve re-watched the session a few times to soak up all the gold nuggets of good practices, tips and tricks, and overall understanding of the package review process. Below, I’ve included the recording of the session, bullet point summaries of what I learned, what I did well, and what I can improve, and then my unpolished and mostly disorganized notes.\nIf you just want to see what changes Nick suggested, see his pull request with suggestions/changes.\nPlease comment and let me know if you learned something new, or if you see something else I can improve in my package development journey!"

    "text": "Notes\nThere are lots of notes of things Nick would wanted to “get to later” but we ran out of time. I left these notes in just to draw attention to other things we would have looked at more closely given more time.\n\nLook at the GitHub repo.\nAbout: provides context, a few features, and link to website.\nWebsite: video demos in README and main page of website\n\nAuthor cares about UX and make it easy to understand what the benefit of the package\nTaking time to add boxes and annotations to videos and screenshots really helpful.\nEmpathy for R users who haven’t been using R for very long. Videos help take the user’s hand and walk them through it.\n\nArticles: will get to later.\n\nRepo and website gives trust that the author wants the pkg to be easily usable and understandable.\n\n\n\nFork the package and copy to machine\nUsed RStudio with New Project from Version Control.\nTook a long time to clone. Not a big deal unless want the pkg on CRAN. Will get to later.\n\nLarge R package. Likely from the example .docx and .html reports that are included.\n\nLook at README to see where video demos came from. Uses GitHub assets, so not included in pkg download. See how to do this in GitHub’s video.\n\n\nCreate new branch for changes/suggestions.\n\n\nRun goodpractice::gp()\nNick’s experience as ROpenSci pkg reviewer to run this static analysis on the code. Makes markers for things that are easy to fix in the pkg.\n{goodpractice} repo\nRun devtools::install_dev_deps() to install everything for the pkg.\nMarkers:\n\nCode lines that are &gt; 80 characters long.\nNo tests\n\nTests are hard. Not sure how to do this with a project template based pkg. Will get back to this.\nMiles: “Yeah so I think testing is hard here because the RStudioApi shows up pretty early in the workflow. To make things easier you could try to separate out as much possible work that can be done without it. then you contain the RStudioAPI stuff in a thin wrapper that wraps the functions that do the work. you can test the ‘do the work’ functions. although it does appear the API is made optional!”\nAdam: “You can use tempdir() as in your example for create_soils() and just check that the directories exists in tempdir() and are created as you expect.”\nMiles: “yeah or maybe there’s a way to make the test for the RStudio API return false in non interactive mode. so put in && interactive() there. then you can run your tests inside RStudio without hitting the API branch.”\nAdam: “I could see writing tests to circumvent the API would be useful, perhaps you could use it as a basis for automating a scripted setup that wasn’t interactive?”\n\nUTF-8 strings? not sure how to fix\nBig installation size\n\nAdam: “Size isn’t a big issue if you don’t plan to put it on CRAN”\n\nNot big deal breakers\n\n\n\nLook through .R files\n\ncreate_soils.R\n\nroxygen function documentation\n\n@examples: how would you use this? Create a soils project like a template R package in the given directory.\n\nFunction definition\n\nNice defensive programming with missing path giving error.\n\nError messages\n\nImprovement: use inline markup syntax in {cli} instead of back ticks for code. Instead of \"`path` is missing.\", use \"{.code path} is missing.\"\nAll classes are in inline-markup of {cli}\nChanged \"{.code path} is missing.\" → \"{.path path} is missing.\"\nKeyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L to call devtools::load_all(\".\").\n\nGot message about ggtern overwriting ggplot2 S3 methods. Come back to this later.\n\nRan create_soils() with path missing to see error. This opened in Browser/debug mode.\nImprovement: add another info message with example:\n\"i\" = \"For example, {.code create_soils('path/to/my/directory')}\"\nRe-ran interactively to see updated error msg. Nice to not worry about including back ticks.\nImprovement: can render the actual path by wrapping it in another pair of curly braces like: \"{.path {path}} already exists.\".\nImprovement: add another info message with example and use \\\\ to create a new line:\n\"i\" = \"To always overwrite: \\\\  \n{.code create_soils({.path {path}} overwrite = TRUE)}\"\nLiked cat_red_bullet a lot. Defined in utils.R\n\nRecommend interactive process\n\nTweak something, load the pkg (load_all), then play around in the console.\n\nLogic of function\n\nif (!isTRUE(overwrite)):\n\nCould have used if (isFALSE(overwrite)) but good practice to leave it as is since overwrite is user-defined\n\nToo much ifelse nesting. Referred to Jenny Bryan’s Code Smells talk.\n\nImprovement: prioritize happy path. Failing early is good. Extract conditions into explaining variables (dir_exists and overwriting). Then use 3 if statements to emphasize each individual case:\n\nif (dir_exists && !overwriting) {...}\nif (dir_exists && overwriting) {...} good to inform user of overwriting existing project\nif (!dir_exists) {...}\n\n\nWould run {grkstyle} at this point after a chunk of refactoring if Nick had it installed.\nCould consider wrapping each case into a function itself like stop_if_dir_exists_and_overwriting(dir_exists, overwriting) {...} to capture the intent. Reduces lines of code. Not a believer of just reducing lines of code. But is believer of writing functions to express yourself. Makes it eaier to browse through the code and maintain later. Nick’s blog post of these thoughts.\nsoils_sys() in utils.R: really liked the fixed blob URL for the exact commit in {golem} for code reference.\n\nCode style\n\nMiles: “Things are looking pretty clean. Did you use {styler} along the way?”.\n\nI used {grkstyle} from Garrick Aden-Buie.\n\nMiles: “One comment I would make having looked around a bit, which is visible here. There are some mixing of approaches / utilities. E.g. base::normalizePath shows up alongside fs:: stuff.”\n\nMiles: “I think it’s safer to keep within one tool’s conception of how things are, otherwise subtle differences in underlying objects / assumptions can create edge cases where things break”\nMiles: “fs::path_norm and fs::path_real are worth a look”\nLooked at what normalizePath() does with ?normalizePath\n\nWas going to rewrite it, but doesn’t fully understand so will leave it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata.R\n\nDidn’t like mix of snake_case and camelCase. If this is a norm in the community, that’s okay.\n\nAdam: “I picked this up too,the functions and some data are snake case but some data are camel case. I’d be consistent for myself and users. For better or worse, I tend to use”.” For separators with units in colnames.”\nMiles: “put units in brackets so you regex them out? or maybe a better engineer would suggest storing them as attributes. Or you have vectors of objects with units if they’re really important to calculations. Oooh oooh {roxyglobals}”\nAdam: “Most times in my work the units aren’t important for calculations but for knowing how it was recorded”\nNaming things and units are hard. I use camel case to delineate words and underscores to separate soil health measurement from the unit. The underscores make pivoting easier.\n\nImprovement: instead of calling it exampleData, call it something more descriptive like washi_example.\nImprovement: add example table or data viz to show some of things I care about.\nData dictionary is really nice: shows what the columns are and what they mean.\nCan quickly normalize names with janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\ndata-raw/example_data.R\n\nGreat to have this included so it’s possible to reproduce the example data. Good signals that I care about this.\n\n\n\nglobals.R\n\nAvoids CRAN check issue.\nImprovement: usethis::use_package_doc() creates a soils-package.R file.\n\nCould move utils::globalVariables() into this file and remove globals.R. Having globals in own R file is fine. Actually kinda like it there.\nLook at dplyr or narniar for examples.\nInclude if(getRversion() &gt;= \"2.15.1\")  utils::globalVariables(c(\".\")) in soils-package.R with globals. Not sure if this is needed?\n\n\n\n\nhelpers.R\n\ncalculate_mode(): R doesn’t include mode function.\n\nAdam: “Oh! Watch the mode. I’ll check your function in a bit, but I’ve a function that allows you to handle multimodal distributions if you’d like. I got burned by my initial function to calculate mode. OK, you’ve got the max. That’s good. I don’t recall what I did first off but I would get the max or min from a multimodal distribution, so I wrote this [function] that handles multimodal distributions”\n\nNoticed use of base pipe.\n\nUpdated DESCRIPTION to depend on R ≥ 4.1.\nFancy triangle ligature from FiraCode-Light\n\nRunning out of time so super quick review\n\n\n\nplots.R\n\nInterested in the S3 methods overwritten by ggtern warning. Indicates something is going on but not sure what.\nOptional: instead of namespacing ggplot2::, can add #' @import ggplot2 to the soils-package.R which is kinda like running library(ggplot2).\nReally likes consistent styling. Makes code easy to read. Can turn off parts of brain to focus on various things.\nDoesn’t have time to confidently to go through plotting code.\nMiles: “I’d like to hear Dr Nick’s opinion on plots.R line 22”\n\nsuppressWarnings wrapped around make_texture_triangle {ggplot2} code.\nNot sure why suppressing warnings. Add comment at closing parentheses. No warnings when Nick ran the function example.\nMiles: “You can even catch and rethrow with more relevant text if that would be helpful to people”\n\n\n\n\n\nVignettes\nLook at get-started.Rmd to understand if it’s all point and click or if there’s code to run:\n\nInstallation: using r-universe (project by ROpenSci), like an alternative to CRAN. Shows author cares about user.\nSee Option 2: RStudio Console\n\nProject structure tree: great and takes time\nFrom annotated screenshots, strong effort to make this easily usable\n\n\nBack to R code: create_soils() in create_soils.R\n\n\nBuild pkg and create soils project\nFollow the point and click instructions for install {soils} with RStudio new project wizard.\n\n\nTesting\nusethis::use_testthat()\nusethis::use_test(\"create-soils\") to create test-create-soils.R template to modify.\n\nLikes dashes over underscores for file names to make it easier to mouse across when holding Alt (1:07:06 timestamp for demoing this). If using underscores, it jumps to the very end.\n\ntest_that(\"create_soils returns appropriate error\", {\n  expect_snapshot_error(\n    create_soils()\n  )\n})\nRunning it once took a snapshot of the error message, which got saved in tests/testthat/_snaps/create-soils.md.\nRunning it again shows the test passed.\nChanged \"`path` is missing.\" → \"{.path path} must be provided.\".\n\nTells user you must provide the path. You need to do this thing.\n\nRun test again. It says the message has changed.\nClick testthat::snapshot_review('create-soils') to interactively review this change.\nShows the diff, which is what we want. Click Accept.\nGood for snapshotting errors and outputs!\n\n\nCommit, push, PR\nCommitted each individual change one at a time with descriptive commit messages.\nWrite commit messages following this template:\n\n[this commit will]… * use tests and snapshot testing\n[this commit will]… * depend on R 4.1.0 since |&gt; is used\n\nThen add a summary headline:\n\nTests, snapshots, base pipe:\n\nAll together, the commit message:\nTests, snapshots, base pipe:\n* use tests and snapshot testing\n* depend on R 4.1.0 since |&gt; is used\nCredit to Adam Brewer (spelling?) for this commit message template of “This commit will…” to remember what he commit does.\nCredit to Miles for idea of using the header and dot points.\nPush then submit PR with suggestions/changes!"

In the last decade, more tools and models have been developed to consider the interactive effects of chemicals within a mixture when conducting risk assessments. Therefore, this study uses actual environmental concentrations measured in 2018 and 2019 from the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Surface Water Monitoring Program. Aquatic risk from exposure was assessed from chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion (as individual chemicals and as binary and ternary mixtures) using the concentration addition model. These pesticides were selected because they have a common mechanism of toxicity, are frequently detected in surface waters in Washington, and were recently evaluated in a biological opinion by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nAll detected concentrations of chlorpyrifos and malathion, assessed as individual chemicals, exceeded the predicted no effect concentration, indicating potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. Further, risk quotients for all binary and ternary mixtures were greater than one, also indicative of potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. In all samples containing a mixture, the maximum cumulative ratio suggested that a single insecticide contributed &gt;50% of the overall toxicity of each mixture. Based on the individual and mixture risk quotients, chlorpyrifos and malathion were the primary drivers of the toxicity of each mixture.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!
