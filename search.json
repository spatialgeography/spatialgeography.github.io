It truly means the world to me.\nThis shop was born from posit::conf(2023), a data science conference with a community of amazing people who happen to love programming & cats. While there are lots of Python, Javascript, and other programming merch out there, there’s little representation for the R statistical language! I hope to change that, with my own twist of adding cute cats to R themed designs.\nAll of my designs are available in any product type. If you see a design you like but want it on something else or would like it personalized, please reach out!"

Use ee.Algorithms whenever possible.\n// Client-side string\nvar clientString = 'Hello World';\n\n// Server-side string\nvar serverString = ee.String('Hello World');\n\n// Do NOT do this:\n// var result = serverString + ' from GEE'; // Error! \n\n// Do this instead:\nvar result = serverString.cat(ee.String(' from GEE'));\nprint(result);"
