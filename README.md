### Hi there! <img src="assets/img/JR-logo-circle.webp" alt="Logo for Jadey Ryan&apos;s personal website: a cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" height="85"/> [![](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b58c2e5b-cf60-4b13-aa25-743b13f3cbf7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jadeynryan/deploys)

Welcome to the repo of my personal website, which was created with
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'm happy to share my website publicly to inspire others and help you create
your own dream site. Feel free to learn from it or use parts of it as a starting
point.

If you do, please include attribution ([CC BY-NC-SA
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)) and take the time
to make the design and content your own.

I've put a lot of care into building this site, and I'd love for it to spark
your own creativity rather than be copied directly.

As [Silvia Canelón](https://silviacanelon.com/) says, **happy repo-diving!**
